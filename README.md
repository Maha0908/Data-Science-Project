What is EDA?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.
EDA helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.
EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate.
**Types of EDA**
There are four primary types of EDA:
*Univariate non-graphical
*Univariate graphical
*Multivariate non-graphical
*Multivariate graphical
**EDA tools**
*Specific statistical functions and techniques you can perform with EDA tools include:
*Clustering and dimension reduction techniques, which help create graphical displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables.
*Univariate visualization of each field in the raw dataset, with summary statistics.
*Bivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable you’re looking at.
*Multivariate visualizations, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the data.
*K-means clustering, which is a clustering method in unsupervised learning where data points are assigned into K groups, i.e. the number of clusters, based on the distance from each group’s centroid. The data points closest to a particular centroid will be clustered under the same category. K-means clustering is commonly used in market segmentation, pattern recognition, and image compression.
*Predictive models, such as linear regression, use statistics and data to predict outcomes.
